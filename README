These are 630/730MTG terminal downloadable programs given to me by
people working for the former AT&T Bell-Labs Indian Hill Naperville IL
location, now Nokia.  They are all little-endian COFF files suitable
for uploading from x86 hosts.  Some of them came to me big-endian but
I converted them on an SVR4 system running under virtual box using
the m32conv program from the dev5620 package.
