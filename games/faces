The following faces appear during the course of the game.  Don't ask me
who's who.

Allen, Becker, Blount, Brown, Burton, Cassoni, Day, Dwyer, Edwards, Feiner,
Flavin, Green, Hirsch, Marshall, Olson, O'Shea, Ross, Scanlon, Sheehan,
Tannenbaum, Tarbox, and Tobias

The terrible trio is comprised of Kernighan, Ritchee and Thompson.

Charlie Brown is the person with the deadly speech.  His speech I'm sure
we all recognize:

"After considerable reflection, I've isolated what to me is the one element
above all others that should stand as the overarching goal and that can
assure excellence in all our endeavors large or small. The overarching goal:
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION."
